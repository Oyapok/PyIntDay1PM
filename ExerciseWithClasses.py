Given a file with the following format:
    
    City name;time;date;temperature
    Geneva;12:34;2003/12/23;2.34;
    Lausanne;12:36;2003/12/23;3.34;
    Bern;12:36;2003/12/23;-3.34;
    ....
    
Write a python script to parse this file and store it's content into a "custom
object".

You could define a class "Record" that will represent a line of this file and
a class "ListOfRecord" to represent a list of "Record".
This class "ListOfRecord" should offer a way to construct an instance of it
with the help of a text file like the one above.
It should also offers ways to save/restore the list easily.
And a method to compute the average of the temperature recorded for a given city name.

with open("data.txt") as fic:
    first=fic.readline()
    for line in fic:
        print(line)
